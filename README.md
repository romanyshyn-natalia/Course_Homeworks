# Project_name: MEDex
Final project of Programming Basics course at Ukrainian Catholic University.
# Description:
With the rapid growth of electronic health records (EHRs), it is wonderful that we are able to collect information and knowledge from EHRs to support automated systems at the point of care and to enable secondary use of EHRs for clinical research.
<br>
The MEDex aims to process raw medical reports and extract specific named entities:
* ID
* Admission Date
* Discharge Date
* Age
* Gender
* Medications
* Diseases
<br>
The results of the program are written to a json file with named entities as keys and lists with extracted data.

Also, there is an example of Exploratory Analysis of extracted medical information with interactive plots and charts. You can try it or just use extracted dataset for your own research work. All the information about the process of developing that project and research is available on the project's wiki.
